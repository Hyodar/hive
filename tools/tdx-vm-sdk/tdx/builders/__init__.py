"""Standard builder modules for common languages.

Each builder module provides a way to compile source code for a specific
language/toolchain. Builders handle compiler sourcing (precompiled download
or build-from-source), reproducibility flags, and artifact installation.

These are regular modules — you can use them, extend them, or replace them.
