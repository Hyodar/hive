# 🐝 Hive

Manage a swarm of AI coding agents across multiple machines.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the manager

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd agent-setup
sudo ./hive init         # Installs hive, configures Telegram bot + worker registry
sudo tailscale up        # Connect to tailnet
```

### 2. Provision a worker

```bash
hive worker setup root@192.168.1.100 --name agent-vm-1
```

This SSHes into the machine, installs all AI tools and dependencies, copies the shared Telegram config, and opens a session for you to run `tailscale up`.

### 3. Send work, get results

```bash
cd ~/my-project
hive repo send agent-vm-1 main     # Push repo to worker
# ... worker does its thing ...
hive repo fetch agent-vm-1 main    # Pull results back
```

### 4. Access a worker

```bash
hive worker ssh agent-vm-1         # SSH into the worker
hive repo ssh agent-vm-1           # SSH directly into the repo directory
# Or use NoMachine for GUI access
```
